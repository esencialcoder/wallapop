# Wallapop Frontend - Web Development Practice

This project is a frontend implementation of a Wallapop-like application, developed without JavaScript frameworks, using the sparrest.js API as a simulated backend.

## 🚀 Implemented Features

- ✅ List of ads with state management (loading, empty, error, success).

- ✅ Detailed view of individual ads.

- ✅ Ad creation (only if the user is authenticated).

- ✅ User login with JWT.

- ✅ User registration.

- ✅ Error handling, redirects, and token storage.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- HTML + CSS (optional boostrap)

- JavaScript ES Modules

- No frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.)

- Local backend: sparrest.js (based on json-server)

## ▶️ How to run the project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esencialcoder/wallapop
cd wallapop
```
### 2. Install and run the backend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertocasero/sparrest.js
cd sparrest.js
npm install
npm start
```
🔗 The backend will be available in: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### 3. Open the frontend
Open the pages/ad-list.html file directly in your browser or use an extension like Live Server in VSCode.
## 🧪 Sample data (db.json)
It includes a db.json file with users, ads, and test tokens for easy correction.
